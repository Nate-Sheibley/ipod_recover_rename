# ipod_recover_rename
Unscrambles and sorts mused pulled from ipod hard drives according to song metadata 

# Purpose
When an ipod had music added to it the ipod stores it in Fxy folders with 4 character strings per song. 

This script will deconvolute those folders into one base folder, than sort the songs into artist-album-song dir-dir-file heirarchy.

# Instructions
Copy the "Music" folder from the ipod disk into the Music folder in this repo.

It should look like ipod_recover_rename/Music/ + a ton of folders with naming Fxy


TODO:
* all
* add support for 'feat.' where the song is sorted into the first artist's folder
* add the folder structure support
